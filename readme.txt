Rubik cube for Graphics course
by Teodor Linnik

I created no additional files for this assignment

I did the rotation by using array for each cube, and rotate the array according to the received operation
To allow random rotation, I created operation queue.
I support Up,down,front,back,left,right rotation as requested in the assignment
To rotate, press the matching key or press the center cube of the cube face
The motion functionality located at game.cpp (Game::Motion function) 

I also added bonus feature for different cube size
To change cube size, change "RUBIC_DIMENSION" define at game.h line 7.
